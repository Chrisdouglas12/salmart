2. Buying and Selling Responsibly<br><br>

Sellers must provide accurate descriptions, images, and prices for their products.

Buyers should communicate clearly and follow through with purchases.

All transactions should be conducted within the platform to ensure security and accountability.

4. Secure and Fair Transactions<br><br>

We use an escrow payment system to protect both buyers and sellers.

Buyers should confirm receipt of an item before funds are released to the seller.

Chargebacks, unauthorized refunds, or fraudulent disputes will result in account suspension.<br><br>


5. Privacy and Safety<br><br>

Do not share personal information (phone numbers, addresses, banking details) in public forums or comments.
